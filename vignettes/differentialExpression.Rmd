## Introduction

The `adaptest` R package can be used to perform data-mining and high-dimensional statistical tests that is common in differential expression studies. The package utilizes a two stage procedure:
1. data-mining stage: reduce the dimension of biomarkers based on the associations of biomarkers with an exposure variable.
2. multiple testing stage: adjust for multiple testing to control false positives.
In this vignette, we illustrate how to use `adaptest` to perform such analysis, using a data set containing microarray expression measures.

## Data-mining stage

First, we load the `adaptest` package and the (included) `simpleArray` data set:

```{r setup_data}
set.seed(1234)
library(adaptest)
data(simpleArray)
"%ni%" = Negate("%in%")
```

In order to perform Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation, we need three
separate data structures: (1) _W_, baseline covariates that could potentially
confound the association of biomarkers with the exposure of interest; (2) _A_,
the point exposure of interest; and (3) _Y_, the biomarkers of interest. All values in _A_ ought to be binarized, in order to avoid practical violations of
the assumption of positivity. To invoke the data-adaptive testing function (`adaptest`), we also need to specify the number of top biomarkers `n_top` to the data-mining algorithm, and the number of folds `n_fold` for cross-validation. The smaller `n_top` is, the more selective data-mining algorithm we have. The larger `n_fold` is, more folds are carried our in cross validaiton.

The TMLE-based biomarker discovery process can be invoked using the
`adaptest` function. The procedure is quite resource-intensive because it
evaluates the association of each individual potential biomarker (of which there
are 1e3 in the included data set) with an exposure of interest, while
accounting for potential confounding based on all other covariates included in
the design matrix. We demonstrate the necessary syntax for calling
`adaptest` below:

```{r adaptest_eval, eval=TRUE}
adaptestout <- adaptest(Y = Y,
                       A = A,
                       W = NULL,
                       n_top = 10,
                       n_fold = 3,
                       parameter_wrapper = adaptest::rank_DE)
```

```{r load_adaptest_result, eval=FALSE}
data(adaptestout)
```

The output of `adaptest` is an object of class `adaptest`, containing the following objects:
(1) top_index: (integer vector) - indices for the data-mining selected biomarkers
(2) top_colname: (character vector) - names for the data-mining selected biomarkers
(3) top_colname_significant_q: (character vector) - names for the data-mining selected biomarkers, which are significant after multiple testing stage
(4) DE: (numeric vector) - differential expression effect sizes for the biomarkers in \code{top_colname}
(5) p_value: (numeric vector) - p-values for the biomarkers in \code{top_colname}
(6) q_value: (numeric vector) - q-values for the biomarkers in \code{top_colname}
(7) significant_q: (integer vector) - indices of \code{top_colname} which is significant after multiple testing stage.
(8) mean_rank_top: (numeric vector) - average ranking across cross-validation folds for the biomarkers in \code{top_colname}
(9) folds: (origami::folds class) - cross validation object

After invoking `adaptest`, the resultant `adaptest` object will have the slots described above completely filled in. The statistical results of this procedure can be extracted using `summary` method.

## Interpret + Visualize the Results

This package provides several interpretation methods that can be used to tabular and visualize the results of the data-adaptive tests.

The `get_composition` method for a `adaptest` object will produce a table of composition of each data-adaptive parameters that is significant after multiple testing stage:

```{r get_comp_small}
get_composition(object = adaptestout, type = 'small')
```

Setting the argument `type = "big"` will instead produce a table of composition of each data-adaptive parameters before multiple testing stage, so that there are more columns

```{r get_comp_big}
get_composition(object = adaptestout, type = 'big')
```

The `plot` method for a `adaptest` object will produce two plots that help user interpret the results. The first plot is a plot of sorted average CV-rank for all the biomarkers in the original dataset (`Y`). The second plot is a plot of sorted q-values with labels corresponding to the indices of the data-adaptive parameter (as returned in `get_composition`)

```{r plot}
plot(adaptestout)
```
